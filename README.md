================================

Web Application written in Java, using JSF as a framework and Maven, Primefaces, Hibernate, Spring as key technologies.
In order to use application please follow the steps:


1. Only thing that you need is, install MySql in your computer and set its admin username and password to - 'root'. 
You can change the default password and database configurations from 
Project->GWorkflow->Java Resources->application-context.xml/hibernate.cgf.xml/hibernate.properties.

2. Create database with name workflowtest. Again you can change its name from the files listed above.

3. Import project to eclipse, and run it on Apache Tomcat 7. And thats it.  

No need to create tables, messing time with databases.

You can look at screenshots , in "screenshots" folder.
