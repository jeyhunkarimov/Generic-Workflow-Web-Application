In order to use application please follow the steps:

You can change the default password and database configurations from 
Project->GWorkflow->Java Resources->application-context.xml/hibernate.cgf.xml/hibernate.properties.

2. Create database with name workflowtest. Again you can change its name from the files listed above.
